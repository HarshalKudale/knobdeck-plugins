# Stream Deck plugin analysis — top 20 and KnobDeck coverage

Snapshot: 2026-11-03. Purpose: pick which Stream Deck plugins to adapt, list each one's actions, how it
works, its Windows/macOS support, and what KnobDeck already has, so adaptations do not miss actions.

## Method and sources

- **Size of the catalogue:** the Elgato Marketplace lists **1,764 Stream Deck plugins** (`count` from the
  Marketplace API, 2026-11-03).
- **Ranking:** Marketplace API `https://mp-gateway.elgato.com/products?extension=plugins&ordering=-download_count`.
  The Marketplace does not show download counts, but this ordering works. Elgato's own end-of-2025 post
  calls Volume Controller "the most downloaded plugin", which matches #1 here.
- **OS support:** the `OS` tag and each version's `os_versions` (minimum OS) from
  `https://mp-gateway.elgato.com/products/<id>`.
- **Actions:** the Marketplace description, the plugin's open-source `manifest.json` (Fred Emmott's
  plugins) or the vendor docs (docs.barraider.com). Most plugin packages need a signed-in Marketplace
  account to download, so manifests of closed-source plugins were **not** read. Action lists marked
  *(partial)* come from marketing text and need checking against the real plugin before we build.

Legend: **W** = Windows, **M** = macOS. "Min" = minimum OS from the Marketplace.

(#5, #11, #12, #15, #17, #20), none are macOS-only. KnobDeck already covers 3 fully or mostly
(#2, #3, #20) and 6 partly (#1, #10, #11, #12, #15, #16). After merging duplicates
(Spotify ×2, Twitch ×2) the **new plugins** are: Voicemod, Spotify, Elgato Lights, Twitch, YouTube,
Clocks, Weather, Streamlabs (+ Wave Link later).

## 3. Per-plugin detail (top 20)

Each entry: how the Stream Deck plugin works → its actions → KnobDeck route → gaps (what to add).

### #1 Volume Controller — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅ (per-app W only)
**How it works:** native audio APIs (WASAPI sessions on Windows, CoreAudio devices on macOS). App
volume needs per-process audio sessions, which macOS does not expose (it would need a virtual audio
driver), so app control is Windows-only.
**Actions:** Profile (build a page from currently playing apps) · App volume (key/dial: set, ±, mute) ·
Input device volume · Output device volume.
**KnobDeck:** win-tools has app volume set/±/mute/slider; mac-tools has device pickers and mic mute.
**Gaps:**
- W: input/output **device volume** (set, ±, mute, slider) — `IAudioEndpointVolume`.
- M: input/output device volume and mute — CoreAudio `kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` / `…Mute`.
- W: "Profile from current apps" → a dynamic wheel/page of active audio sessions (fits our dynamic wheel).
- M: per-app volume — **not feasible** without a driver; leave out (Elgato doesn't support it either).

### #2 OBS Studio — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**How it works:** obs-websocket (built into OBS 28+), live state on keys.
**Actions:** Record · Record Pause · Stream · Replay Buffer · Save Replay · Scene Collection · Scene ·
Source (show/hide) · Mute (source audio) · Media (playback) · Studio Mode · Preview Scene (push live) ·
Filter · Screenshot · Transition · Chapter Marker. Dials: source volume, etc.
**KnobDeck:** `obs` has all 16 plus Virtual Cam and Profile.
**Gaps:** source **volume dial/slider** (check `audio-mixer` covers only mute). Otherwise none.

### #3 Discord — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**How it works:** Discord desktop RPC over IPC with OAuth.
**Actions:** Mute · Deafen · Voice Channel · Text Channel · Push to Talk · Push to Mute · Video Toggle ·
Stream Toggle · (15 total incl. volume, audio device, soundboard).
**KnobDeck:** `discord` covers all and adds wheels, DM, activity, notifications. **Gaps:** none known.

### #4 Voicemod — Voicemod · W ✅ M ✅ *(partial action list)*
**How it works:** talks to the Voicemod desktop app over its local **Control API** (websocket on
localhost; needs an API key from Voicemod's developer programme — check licence terms before building).
**Actions:** Select voice (per key, with voice image) · Random voice · Toggle voice changer on/off ·
Toggle "hear myself" · Toggle background effects · Play sound / meme · Stop all sounds ·
Mute mic · Bleep/censor (hold).
**KnobDeck route:** app's local websocket (Rule 1 tier 3). Same code on W and M.
**Helper needed:** no (Voicemod app is the endpoint). **Account:** Voicemod API key (ours, as developer).

### #5 Spotify Integration — BarRaider · W ✅ M ❌ *(partial action list)*
**How it works:** Spotify **Web API** with the user's own developer app (Client ID/secret, redirect
`http://127.0.0.1:4202`); **Premium required** for playback control.
**Actions:** Play/Pause (device picker) · Next/Previous · Shuffle · Repeat · Volume set/± (dial) ·
Mute · Like/Save track · Play URI (playlist/album/track) · Add to playlist · Now-playing display.
**Adapt:** merge into one `spotify` plugin with #8 (below).

### #6 Control Center — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**How it works:** Elgato Key Light / Ring Light / Light Strip expose a local REST API
(`http://<light>:9123/elgato/lights`), found by mDNS (`_elg._tcp`). Control Center app not required
for the API itself.
**Actions:** Power (one/all) · Set brightness · Adjust brightness · Set temperature · Adjust
temperature · Set colour (Light Strip) · Battery (Key Light Mini). Dials: brightness, temperature
(press = on/off).
**KnobDeck route:** HTTP to the light, mDNS discovery. Pure Rust, same on W and M. No helper.
Natural fit for KnobDeck sliders/dials.

### #7 Twitch — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅  ·  #17 Twitch Tools — BarRaider · W ✅ M ❌
**How it works:** Twitch Helix REST API + chat (IRC/websocket) + EventSub, OAuth sign-in.
**Actions (#7):** Chat message · Clear chat · Emote-only · Follower-only · Sub-only · Slow mode ·
Ad break · Stream info (title/category) · Marker · Viewer count · Create clip · Open clip.
**Actions (#17, partial):** Giveaways · Clip-to-chat · Send chat message · Ban user · Update title/tags ·
Twitch Pager (flash on follow/sub/bits/channel points or `!page`) · Channel Monitor (favourite streamers live).
**Adapt:** one `twitch` plugin (W, M). Needs our own Twitch app client id; token exchange like
Discord (code → KnobDeck website, never ship a secret). Alerts map to KnobDeck notifications.

### #8 Spotify — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅ (macOS 12+)
**How it works:** basic playback via the **Spotify desktop app**; library/search/queue/playlists need
Spotify sign-in (Web API).
**Actions:** Playback (play/pause/toggle/prev/next) · Shuffle · Repeat (cycle) · Volume (step) ·
Save to Liked Songs · Add to playlist · Play Collection (playlists, liked, albums, podcasts, top
tracks…) · Saved Search · Queue · Sleep Timer. Dials: Multimedia browser, Play Collection,
Saved Search, Queue. Infobar: Now Playing.
**KnobDeck route for `spotify` (merges #5, #8):**
- M: AppleScript `tell application "Spotify"` (play/pause, next, prev, volume, shuffle, repeat,
  current track) — no account, no Premium. Library features via Web API.
- W: no scripting interface; now-playing and play/pause/next/prev via **SMTC**
  (`GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager`, WinRT) — no account. Shuffle/repeat/volume/
  library via Web API (Premium for playback commands).
- Web API: OAuth PKCE (no secret to ship). Spotify's dev-mode limit is 25 users until the app is
  approved — apply early, or let users bring their own client id like BarRaider.
**Helper:** none.

### #9 YouTube — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**How it works:** YouTube Data / Live Streaming API, Google OAuth.
**Actions:** Viewers (live count) · Chat message · Play ad · Open dashboard · Start/Stop stream.
**KnobDeck route:** Google APIs over HTTP, same on both OSes. **Risk:** Google OAuth app
verification for the `youtube` scope and API quota — plan time for it. Lower priority than Twitch.

### #10 Audio Switcher — Fred Emmott · W ✅ M ✅ (open source)
**How it works:** Windows: undocumented `IPolicyConfig` COM to set the default endpoint
(long-stable, used by every switcher); macOS: CoreAudio default-device properties.
**Actions (manifest):** Toggle Audio Device (between two) · Set Audio Device. Options: input/output,
default vs communications role.
**KnobDeck:** mac-tools has Output/Input device wheels. **Gaps:** W — device switching is missing
from win-tools (set, toggle-between-two, wheel). M — add "Set device" key and "Toggle two" key.

### #11 Win Tools — BarRaider · W ✅ *(partial action list)*
**Actions:** App/device volume · Bluetooth on/off · Wi-Fi on/off · Explorer Scratch Pad (cycle common
folders) · Multi-Clip (each key a separate clipboard slot) · Ping (latency on key) · Power plan switch ·
Windows services start/stop/restart · Virtual desktops.
**KnobDeck:** win-tools has app volume, virtual desktops (keystroke), clipboard history wheel.
**Gaps (W):** Bluetooth / Wi-Fi radio toggle (WinRT `Windows.Devices.Radios`), power plan
(`PowerSetActiveScheme`), services (SCM API, needs elevation — note UAC), ping (ICMP `IcmpSendEcho`),
Multi-Clip slots, folder scratch pad (fits Open path + wheel).
**macOS twins for mac-tools:** Wi-Fi (CoreWLAN), Bluetooth (no public on/off API — skip or IOBluetooth
private), Low Power Mode (`pmset`, needs admin), ping, multi-clip.

### #12 OBS Tools — BarRaider · W ✅ M ❌
**How it works:** obs-websocket.
**Actions:** Smart scene switcher (preview/live borders) · Source animation (multi-phase moves) ·
Studio mode toggle · Video player (switch file/speed) · Source volume (set/±) · Dropped-frames alarm ·
OBS CPU usage · Previous scene · Twitch integration (`!replay`, clips) · Browser sources (URL/refresh) ·
Remote recording toggle (other PC) · Set transition · Filter toggle · Instant replay (save + play back).
**Gaps for `obs`:** previous scene, source volume set/± and slider, stats keys (CPU, dropped frames,
FPS — `GetStats`), browser source refresh / set URL, preview/program border state on scene keys,
multiple OBS connections (remote PC), instant replay playback. Source animation: later.

### #13 Clocks — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**Actions:** My Clock (analog/digital, 30+ styles, 12/24 h, date) · World Clock (time zones,
dial to switch) · Countdown timer.
**KnobDeck route:** pure Rust (`chrono`/`chrono-tz`), rendered key image. Could be host built-ins
instead of a plugin. Also add a Stopwatch/Timer (Stream Deck has a built-in Timer action).

### #14 Wave Link (Legacy) — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**How it works:** Wave Link app's local websocket API (Wave Link 2; v3 uses a newer plugin, #26).
**Actions:** Input (set/±/mute per mix) · Output (set/±/mute, switch mix) · Device (gain, monitor
mix, output switch) · Effects (toggle effect or chain). Dials for each.
**Decision:** defer — only useful with Elgato Wave mics; Legacy is frozen. If built, target Wave Link 3.

### #15 SuperMacro — BarRaider · W ✅ M ❌
**How it works:** SendInput keyboard + mouse simulation with a macro language.
**Actions:** Super Macro · Super Macro Toggle (two macros) · Sticky Super Macro (repeat until pressed
again) · Keystroke PTT (repeat while held) · Sticky Keystroke · Mouse Location (shows X,Y).
Language: `{{ctrl}{c}}` chords, `{{PAUSE:ms}}`, mouse move/click/scroll, variables, functions, loops,
read from file.
**KnobDeck:** host Keybind + Multi + Delay + Text snippet cover simple macros.
**Gaps (host, both OSes):** mouse move/click/scroll steps, repeat-while-held, repeat-until-pressed,
text with variables (date, clipboard). Allowed under Rule 1 because the action *is* input.
macOS needs Accessibility permission (already required by mac-tools).

### #16 Audio Mute — Fred Emmott · W ✅ M ✅ (open source)
**Actions (manifest):** Toggle Mute · Mute · Unmute — any input or output device (default or chosen).
Key shows muted state.
**KnobDeck:** mac-tools Mic mute toggle. **Gaps:** W — device mute toggle/mute/unmute in win-tools
(`IAudioEndpointVolume::SetMute`, with state feedback). M — pick a specific device and output mute;
explicit Mute / Unmute (for multi-actions). Add push-to-talk (hold) on both.

### #18 Weather — Elgato · W ✅ M ✅
**Actions:** Weather (current temp/conditions, press = high/low; dial = hourly/daily/chart) ·
Forecast (multi-day) · Air Quality (AQI).
**KnobDeck route:** Open-Meteo (free, no key, has AQI) over HTTP; location by city search or
coordinates. Same on both OSes. No helper.

### #19 Streamlabs — Streamlabs · W ✅ M ✅ *(partial action list)*
**How it works:** Streamlabs Desktop's local websocket/JSON-RPC API (token from Settings ▸ Remote Control).
**Actions:** Go live / end stream · Start/stop recording · Switch scene · Toggle source · Mute audio
source · Save replay · Alerts (skip, pause/unpause, mute alert sound).
**KnobDeck route:** local API, both OSes; very close to our OBS plugin's shape — share helpers.
(#31 "Streamlabs Desktop" is the newer listing of the same app; build one plugin.)

### #20 Windows Mover & Resizer — BarRaider · W ✅ M ❌
**Actions:** Windows Mover — target focused window **or a specific app**, choose screen, position
(capture current), size, maximize/minimize; dial version; virtual-desktop move.
**KnobDeck:** win-tools / mac-tools have positions, monitors, custom position, dynamic wheels.
**Gaps:** "specific application" target (by exe / bundle id) on fixed keys; "capture current window
position" button in the custom-position input; move window to another virtual desktop/Space (no
public API on either OS — skip).

## 4. Stream Deck built-in actions vs KnobDeck host

| Stream Deck built-in | KnobDeck |
|---|---|
| Hotkey, Open (app/file), Website, Multimedia, Text | ✅ Keybind, Launch / Open path, Open URL, media keys, Text snippet (win/mac-tools) |
| Multi Action, Multi Action Switch, Create Folder | ✅ Multi, Multi-toggle, Folder |
| Hotkey Switch (two hotkeys on one key) | ✅ via Multi-toggle |
| Delay (inside multi action) | ✅ Delay |
| Switch Profile, Previous/Next Page, Go to Page, Page Indicator | check — Link kind covers navigation; confirm page/profile switching |
| Random Action | ❌ add (host) |
| Timer / Stopwatch | ❌ add (with Clocks) |
| Soundboard (play audio file, stop) | ❌ add (host or small plugin; play to a chosen output device) |
| Brightness / Sleep of the device | n/a (phone/dial device; check for screen-dim action) |

---

## 5. Helper extensions / companion apps to build and maintain

A KnobDeck plugin alone cannot drive an app that has no external interface. Then we ship a helper that
runs *inside* the app and exposes a local endpoint.

| Helper | Status | Used by | Ships to | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KnobDeck VS Code Companion (extension) | **exists** (`knobdeck-companion/vscode`) | `vscode` | VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX (for Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf) | Local HTTP action server, host/port/password. Must track VS Code API changes. |
| KnobDeck IntelliJ Companion (IDE plugin) | **exists** (`knobdeck-companion/intellij`) | `intellij` | JetBrains Marketplace | Java. Rebuild/verify for each yearly IDE platform (`sinceBuild`/`untilBuild`). |
| Browser extension (WebExtension) + native messaging host | **proposed** | `browser-plugin` | Chrome Web Store, Edge Add-ons, Firefox AMO | Removes keystrokes on Windows and Firefox/Zen: tabs, zoom, reload, find via `chrome.tabs` API. One extension codebase, 3 stores. |
| — | not needed | OBS, Discord, VLC, Zoom, Voicemod, Streamlabs, Wave Link | — | The app already has a local API (enable it in the app's settings). |
| — | not needed | Spotify, Twitch, YouTube, Weather, Elgato lights | — | Web/LAN APIs. Need our OAuth apps (Spotify, Twitch, Google) and a token-exchange endpoint on the KnobDeck website, as Discord has. |

Out of the top 20 but likely next, and **helper-required**: Adobe Photoshop / Premiere / Lightroom
(UXP plugin), Microsoft Office/Teams (Office add-in or Graph API), DaVinci Resolve (scripting API,
Studio only on some features). Plan a helper repo per host app, each with its own store release.

Maintenance cost per helper: one more store listing, signing, review cycle and version-compat matrix.
Keep the protocol (HTTP + password, same as vscode/intellij) identical across helpers so the Rust side
reuses one client.

## 8. Suggested order

1. **Fill gaps in what we already ship** (cheap, high value): Windows device volume/mute/switch
   (#1, #10, #16), OBS extras (#2, #12), Win Tools extras (#11), mover "specific app" (#20).
2. **Spotify** (#5 + #8) — two of the top 8.
3. **Elgato Lights** (#6), **Weather** (#18), **Clocks/Timer** (#13) — no accounts, quick wins.
4. **Twitch** (#7 + #17), **Voicemod** (#4), **Streamlabs** (#19).
5. **YouTube** (#9) — after Google verification. **Wave Link 3** (#26) if users ask.
6. Host: macro steps, random action, soundboard (#15, built-ins).

## 9. Next 10 (ranks 21–50), picked 2026-11-08

Re-ran the ranking on 2026-11-08 (1,798 plugins). Ranks 1–20 have not moved, so the top 20 above still
holds. Picks favour plugins for apps and network services that can ship on Windows, macOS and Linux.

| Pick | Stream Deck plugin (rank) | KnobDeck plugin | Route (Rule 1 tier) | OS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Home Assistant (#29) | `home-assistant` | HA REST + websocket API, long-lived token (3) | W M L |
| 2 | Philips Hue (#36) | `hue` | Hue Bridge local API v2, mDNS discovery, link-button pairing (3) | W M L |
| 3 | Advanced Launcher (#22) | `game-launcher` | Steam `libraryfolders.vdf` + `steam://rungameid`, Epic / GOG manifests, MS Store apps on W (3, 4) | W M L |
| 4 | YouTube Music Desktop Connector (#46) | `ytmusic` | YTMDesktop v2 Companion Server (REST + socket.io, in-app auth approval) (3) | W M L |
| 5 | PowerPoint (#43) | `slides` | PowerPoint COM on W, PowerPoint + Keynote AppleScript on M, LibreOffice Impress UNO on L (3) | W M L |
| 6 | VoiceMeeter Integration (#48) | `voicemeeter` | `VoicemeeterRemote64.dll`, loaded at runtime (3) | W |
| 7 | Sound Deck (#25) + Soundpad (#45) | `soundboard` | play files to a chosen output device (cpal/rodio), Soundpad pipe on W (1, 3) | W M L |
| 8 | Govee Controller (#39) | `govee` | Govee LAN API (UDP multicast), cloud API key as fallback (3) | W M L |
| 9 | Midi (#49) | `midi` | OS MIDI (WinMM / CoreMIDI / ALSA) via `midir`, virtual port on M/L (1) | W M L |
| 10 | Speed Test (#21) | `speedtest` | Cloudflare speed endpoints (Ookla has no public API) (3) | W M L |

Not picked, and why:
- **Covered already:** Discord Volume Mixer (#23, `discord` user volume + member wheel), System Vitals
  (#28) and GPU Metrics (#42) (System stats in the tools plugins; add network/temps there),
  Streamlabs Desktop (#31), Window Mover (#32), Audio Mixer (#38, tools app volume), Visual Studio Code
  (#44), Zoom (#50).
- **Hardware we can't test here:** Wave Link 3 (#26, Elgato mics), iCUE (#27, Corsair), Camera Hub
  (#30, Elgato cameras), Battery (#34, vendor SDKs). Build when there is a device to test on.
- **Keystrokes only (Rule 1):** ShadowPlay (#24), TikTok LIVE Studio (#33): no API.
- **Needs a helper inside the app:** Adobe Photoshop (#41, UXP plugin). Larger project.
- **Not a fit / small:** Advanced Screen Saver (#40), Windows Cockpit Pro (#47, overlaps win-tools),
  Stream Counter (#35, could be a counter action in `clocks`), YouTube Ticker (#37, `youtube` viewers).

| game-launcher 1.0.0 (#22): Launch Game (with the game's icon), Games Wheel (recent / A–Z), Open Launcher Page; Steam everywhere, Epic on Windows/macOS | done (read this machine's real Steam library; Epic manifest parsing unit-tested only).
